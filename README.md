# NODE.JS - Real-Time Chat Room w/Socket.io & Express

### About

Real-time chat application built with Socket.io, Node/Express, Vanilla JS (and a few other smaller dependencies), complete with unique chat rooms and individual users. When a user enters and exits a chat room, a message is broadcast to the users in that specific room of their action. The sidebar on the left displays, in real time, what room the user is in, and all of the users within that room, and updates as people come and go.
